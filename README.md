# 🧩 Mini JavaScript Async Challenge

A small coding challenge built with **JavaScript**, exploring **asynchronous programming** concepts like:

- Promises    
- Promisifying callbacks  
- Fetch API  
- setTimeout & image loading sequence  

## ⚡ Description
This mini project shows one image from a URL, then displays another one after 2 seconds — demonstrating async control flow in action.

## 💡 Tech
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML & CSS (minimal setup)

## 🚀 Run
Just open the `.html` file in your browser — no setup required!

## 🧠 Notes
Open Console and check commented codes. Includes examples and comments for learning how asynchronous JavaScript works.
